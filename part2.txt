What are three benefits of using git and cs-gitlab?
-version control, parallel development by multiple people, branching for different builds
What does the term "stage" mean in git and why is it important?  How do developers stage things in git?
-files staged for commit is list of altered/updated files to be submitted to the repository, you add files with "git add <name/regex>"

What is different about the two interaction methods?
-it is easier to navigate with vr headset and controls, unsurprisingly
What is similar about the two interaction methods?
-not much
Give rationale why each interface might be preferred over the other.

What is the purpose of the "Watch" section above above the call stack in the debugger?  Briefly explain how to use it.  What in what kind of situations would it come in handy?
-Chrome DevTools allows you to easily see multiple variables throughout your application. Watching variables within Sources keeps you out of the console and focused on improving your code.
-The Sources panel provides the ability to watch variables within your application. This is located in the watch section of the debugger sidebar. By taking advantage of this functionality you will not need repeatedly log objects to the console.
-To add a variable to the watch list use the add icon to the right of the section heading. This will open an inline input where you provide the variable name to watch. Once it is filled in press your Enter key to add it to the list.

I have been unable to determine how to translate (move left/right, up/down, forward/backwards) WebXR's emulated controllers or headset on systems have 6DOF.  Determine how, and then provide a description of how to do it.
-change headset to htc vive, left bottom corner under the headset preview click rotate and it changes to translate mode, then you can move in space
