What are three benefits of using git and cs-gitlab?
-version control, parallel development by multiple people, branching for different builds
What does the term "stage" mean in git and why is it important?  How do developers stage things in git?
-files staged for commit is list of altered/updated files to be submitted to the repository, you add files with "git add <name/regex>"

What is different about the two interaction methods?
-it is easier to navigate with vr headset and controls, unsurprisingly
What is similar about the two interaction methods?
-not much
Give rationale why each interface might be preferred over the other.
-I would prefer the vr as the UI in browser mode overlays the color selection over part of the table making it unaccessible


What is the purpose of the "Watch" section above above the call stack in the debugger?  Briefly explain how to use it.  What in what kind of situations would it come in handy?
-Chrome DevTools allows you to easily see multiple variables throughout your application. Watching variables within Sources keeps you out of the console and focused on improving your code.
-The Sources panel provides the ability to watch variables within your application. This is located in the watch section of the debugger sidebar. By taking advantage of this functionality you will not need repeatedly log objects to the console.
-To add a variable to the watch list use the add icon to the right of the section heading. This will open an inline input where you provide the variable name to watch. Once it is filled in press your Enter key to add it to the list.

I have been unable to determine how to translate (move left/right, up/down, forward/backwards) WebXR's emulated controllers or headset on systems have 6DOF.  Determine how, and then provide a description of how to do it.
-change headset to htc vive, left bottom corner under the headset preview click rotate and it changes to translate mode, then you can move in space



Lines 60-62 adds a point light in room, and Line 63 adds an ambient light to the room.  Experiment with commenting out the creation of one or both of these lights.  What happens?  Why do you think that is?
-commenting main light hides the textures except for the main board that doesn't react to light, turning off the ambient light reduces the visibility of text
Lines 69-71 effect the position of the boards.  Experiment with changing the values on the right hand sides of these lines.  Relative to original orientation of the camera which directions do the x-, y-, and z-axes point?
-x+ moves each to the right, x- to the left (from perspective of the object, not user), +y upwards, -y downwards, -z away from user, +z towards user
The floating menu is created on Line 93.  If you wanted to create a new item on that menu what would you need to do?  What does the use of boards.map on the previous lines accomplish?
-add new button like 88-91, create new callback function that handles the event
When the user presses the trigger in VR, which function in this file is called first?  How would / did you determine this using the Chrome debugger?
-function onSelectStart(event), can be found in sources>global listeners


Inspect the constructor of the Board class. What are the member variables of the Board class?

What line is responsible for making the board contain white in every cell at the beginning of the program.
-board has method reset(), called in constructor at line 40
What does Line 114 accomplish?
-converts rgb to hex color code
Explain the logic of the if statement conditions in Lines 169-193.
-they look what draw mode we use and according to that call appropriate functions to rasterize input
As you saw above, Lines 69-71 of main.js effect the position of the board.  Which class does the Board class inherit the position member variable from?  Provide a hyperlink to the documentation of the three module for this class.
-object3d https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Object3D.position
Describe how would you refactor Board.js to include the contents of rasterizer.js instead of having it as a separate file.  (Don't actually do it though.)
-I would copypaste all the functions and import from debugconsole.js over there in board.js, someone might want to make static class for all the rasterizer things



The Board class extends the GuiVR class.  What member variable does Board inherit that wasn't present from GuiVR that isn't in their parent class THREE.Group?  What is the purpose of this member variable?  
-.collider, detects whether the click intersects with the board
Put a breakpoint a Line 13 of rasterizer.js.  Explain the call stack when this breakpoint is reached.
-onSelectStart calls guivr.intersectobjects, that detects the intersection callng collide, then the point is to be rasterized on the board so rasterizepoint is called to write the color and text onto the console
What is an abstract class?  Why was GuiVR designed to be an abstract class?
-abstract class is common prototype that groups classes with common variables, it can only be inherited from and cannot be created on it's own
Extra Credit: What would be better documentation for the Board.collide function?  Make sure to discuss the parameter's types, meaning, and the function's overall behavior.
